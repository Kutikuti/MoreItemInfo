# MoreItemInfo

## Overview
MoreItemInfo allows you to add useful informations about items in the tooltip. Currently only RPPM but i have plan to add other useful information.

Don't hesitate to go on the [SimcMinMax] Discord to ask about specific stuff.


## Where does the data comes from?
All data comes from Blizzard API and client Data.

The simulationcraft team built powerful tools to extract all kind of data and all of it is automatically extracted and added into the addon.

If there is hotfixes in game, you will just have to update the addon to get the latest data.
